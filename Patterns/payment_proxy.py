PROXY DESIGN PATTERN: Payment Processing
CIS 476 Term Project: DriveShare
 
This file simulates a payment system using the Proxy pattern.
PaymentService is the real subject that processes payments.
PaymentProxy wraps it, controls access, updates the database,
and sends notifications to both the owner and renter.

Pattern roles:
   Subject     -> IPaymentService (abstract interface)
  RealSubject  -> PaymentService
  Proxy        -> PaymentProxy

# SUBJECT INTERFACE (abstract)
# defines the contract both the real service and the proxy must follow
# the client only ever interacts with this interface — never directly
# with PaymentService or PaymentProxy
class IPaymentService(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def processPayment(self, bookingId: int, amount: float) -> bool: pass


# REAL SUBJECT
# this is the actual payment service — the thing doing the real work
# in a real app this would talk to Stripe, PayPal, etc.
# here we simulate it: we just print and return True to say it succeeded
class PaymentService(IPaymentService):
 
    def processPayment(self, bookingId: int, amount: float) -> bool:

# PROXY
# this wraps PaymentService and adds three extra responsibilities:
#   1. calls the real PaymentService to process the payment
#   2. updates the payments table in the db to 'completed' (or 'failed')
#   3. sends a message notification to both the owner and the renter
# the caller never touches PaymentService directly — it only talks to the proxy
