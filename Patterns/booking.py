BOOKING SYSTEM + OBSERVER PATTERN
CIS 476 Term Project: DriveShare

This file handles two things:
1. Booking logic: taking a car, a renter, and a date range and creating a booking
   while making sure no two bookings overlap (conflict prevention)
2. Observer pattern: notifying renters when a car they're watching
   becomes available or drops in price

# OBSERVER PATTERN


# OBSERVER INTERFACE (abstract)
# this is just the interface: it doesn't do anything on its own
# it just forces every concrete observer (renter/user) to implement update()
# think of it as a contract: if you want to watch a car, you MUST
# have an update() method so the car knows how to reach you
class RenterObserver(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, carId: int, eventType: str, message: str) -> None: pass
    # eventType will be something like "available" or "price_drop"
    # message is the actual text the renter will see


# SUBJECT INTERFACE (abstract)
# defines the contract that every subject (watchable object) must follow
# any class that wants to be observable MUST implement these three methods:
# subscribe (add a watcher), unsubscribe (remove a watcher), notify (alert everyone)
class Subject(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def subscribe(self, observer: RenterObserver) -> None: pass

    @abstractmethod
    def unsubscribe(self, observer: RenterObserver) -> None: pass

    @abstractmethod
    def notify(self, eventType: str, message: str) -> None: pass


# CONCRETE SUBJECT
# this is the car: the thing being watched
# it holds the list of all renters (observers/subscribers) who are watching it
# and it's responsible for notifying them when something changes
# inherits from Subject and implements all three abstract methods
class CarSubject(Subject):

    def __init__(self, carId: int) -> None:
        self.carId = carId

    def unsubscribe(self, observer: RenterObserver) -> None:
        # renter stopped watching: remove them from the list
        self.observers.remove(observer)

        # each observer handles the notification in their own update() method
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.update(self.carId, eventType, message)


# CONCRETE OBSERVER
# this is the actual renter: the one who clicked "select/watch car"
# when the car (subject) calls notify(), it ends up here
# update() is where the real reaction happens:
# we go into the database and store a notification for this renter
class Renter(RenterObserver):

# BOOKING MANAGER (client)
